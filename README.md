# Scatterbrain
Scatterbrain is a personal tool to help me work on multiple projects at the same time.

I often find myself getting bored of a project, then setting it aside indefinitely. I made Scatterbrain so that I can flip the page immediately to another in-flight project, eventually circling back to the one I set down while still getting something done.

## Installation
1. Download the latest release for your OS [here](https://github.com/Syldarion/scatterbrain/releases).
2. Unzip the file and run Scatterbrain.exe.
3. Done

## Usage
Scatterbrain allows you to create and maintain to-do lists for multiple in-flight projects.

In order to start using Scatterbrain, create a new project from File > New Project. You'll be prompted to enter a project name. Now, you should be able to create new tasks. Either right-click in the main view, or click Task > Add Task. Tasks can also be created as children of other tasks.

After creating multiple projects, you are able to use the main feature of Scatterbrain: random project loading! Whenever you find yourself bored of your current project, click File > Open Random Project to be given a new one! This will open a random file from your Scatterbrain directory.

The Scatterbrain directory can be changed from the settings window (File > Settings).

## Contributing
I really only put this section here because it felt commonplace. If you feel like making a change, open up a pull request and I'll check it out. No code of conduct here, just be kind. Try your best to stick to the existing style in the codebase.
