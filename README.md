# Scatterbrain
Scatterbrain is a personal tool to help me work on multiple projects at the same time.

I often find myself getting bored of a project, then setting it aside indefinitely. I made Scatterbrain so that I can flip the page immediately to another in-flight project, eventually circling back to the one I set down while still getting something done.
